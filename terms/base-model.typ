A base model is the initial version of an AI system right after it has been trained on vast amounts of text from the internet but before it has been fine-tuned to be helpful, harmless, and aligned with user expectations.
If you could interact with a base model directly, it would be quite different from the polished chat interfaces you're familiar with.
It might continue your text in unexpected ways, generate random internet-like content, or fail to follow instructions properly, because all it has learned is to predict what text typically follows other text on the internet.
The #link("./chat-assistant.typ")[chat assistants] you use, like ChatGPT or Claude, started as #link("./base-model.typ")[base models], but then underwent additional training phases to transform them from text-completion engines into helpful conversational assistants that understand instructions and maintain appropriate boundaries.
