A chat assistant is the conversational interface you interact with when using AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini: the 'personality' and behavior layer that makes an #link("./llm.typ")[LLM] feel like you're having a dialogue rather than just using a text-completion tool.
While the underlying language model is trained to predict the next word in a sequence, the chat assistant is specifically designed through #link("./alignment.typ")[alignment] and #link("./fine-tuning.typ")[fine-tuning] to maintain context across multiple messages, follow instructions, ask clarifying questions, and respond in a helpful and conversational manner.
When you ask Claude to #quote[help me debug this code] or tell ChatGPT #quote[remember that I prefer Python examples], you're interacting with a carefully designed chat assistant that keeps track of your conversation history and adapts its responses accordingly, rather than treating each message as an isolated #link("./prompt.typ")[prompt].
