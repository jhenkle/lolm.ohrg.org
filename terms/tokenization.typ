Tokenization is the process by which a chat AI system breaks down your message into digestible pieces called tokens before it can understand and respond to you.
Rather than processing entire words as atomic units, the system uses an algorithm to split text into smaller chunks—some common words stay whole, while unusual or complex words get divided into recognizable parts, and punctuation typically becomes separate tokens.
This preprocessing step is invisible to you as a user, but it's crucial because the AI's neural network can only work with these numerical token representations, not raw text, which is why you might notice that systems like ChatGPT count usage in tokens rather than words or characters.
