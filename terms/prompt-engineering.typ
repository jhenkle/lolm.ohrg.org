// Prompt engineering is the practice of carefully crafting the text you provide to an #link("./llm.typ")[LLM] to get better, more accurate, or more useful responses: essentially learning to 'speak' to AI systems in ways that leverage how they actually work.
// This can involve techniques like providing examples in your #link("./prompt.typ")[prompt] (called #link("./few-shot.typ")[few-shot] prompting), breaking complex tasks into step-by-step instructions, specifying the format you want the output in, or even assigning the model a role like #quote[you are an expert Python developer].
// For instance, instead of asking #quote[write a function], a prompt engineer might write #quote[write a Python function called calculate_average that takes a list of numbers and returns their mean. Include error handling for empty lists and non-numeric values. Add docstrings and type hints], which provides the context and constraints that help the model generate exactly what's needed.
// While it might seem like just being more specific, prompt engineering has become a genuine skill because small changes in phrasing can produce dramatically different results, and understanding these patterns can unlock capabilities in the model that aren't obvious at first glance.
